## **Self-Introduction**

I'm currently a faculty member with Hefei University of Technology (HFUT), Hefei, China. I received my Ph.D. degree from the School of Information Science and Technology, University of Science and Technology of China (USTC), Hefei, China, in 2021. Before that, I received my B.E. degree from Hefei University of Technology, China, in 2016. I have published papers in refereed journals and conferences such as TAFFC, TCSVT, AAAI, and ACM MM. I have obtained championships in two international challenges (5th ABAW and 3rd MuSe) in the field of affective computing hosted by CVPR 2023 and MM 2022.

##  **Study & Awards**

###  **Postgraduate Education** @USTC

From 2016 to 2021, I studied at the [School of Information Science and Technology](https://sist.ustc.edu.cn/main.htm) and also the [NERC-SLIP](http://nercslip.ustc.edu.cn/main.htm),  affiliated with University of Science and Technology of China (USTC), where I was awarded the National Scholarship for Postgraduates (研究生国家奖学金), the inaugural Tang Lixin Scholarship (唐立新奖学金), and the Huayu Fund Scholarship (华瑜基金奖学金).

###  **Undergraduate Education** @HFUT

From 2012 to 2016, I majored in Automation at the Department of Information Engineering, Hefei University of Technology (HFUT). I consistently ranked first in my major with a GPA of 92%, as well as in the whole Department (1/800), earning the National Scholarship (国家奖学金) each year. I achieved the first place🥇 in the HFUT Mathematics Competition.

## May you have a nice day :)
