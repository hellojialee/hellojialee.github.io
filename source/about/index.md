## 🐔 **Self-Introduction**

I'm currently a faculty🧑‍🏫 with Hefei University of Technology (HFUT)🏫, Hefei, China. I received my Ph.D. degree from the School of Information Science and Technology, University of Science and Technology of China (USTC), Hefei, China, in 2021. Before that, I received my B.E. degree in automation from Hefei University of Technology, China, in 2016. I have published papers📑 in refereed journals and conferences such as TCSVT, TMM, AAAI, and ACM MM. I have obtained championships🏆🏆 in two international challenges  (5th ABAW and 3rd MuSe) in the field of affective computing hosted by CVPR 2023 and MM 2022.

## 🥇 **Study & Awards**

### 🧑‍🦲 **Postgraduate Education** @USTC

From 2016 to 2021, I studied at the Department of Automation, School of Information Science and Technology,  University of Science and Technology of China (USTC), where I was awarded the National Scholarship for Postgraduates (研究生国家奖学金), the inaugural Tang Lixin Scholarship (唐立新奖学金), and the Huayu Fund Scholarship (华瑜基金奖学金).

### 👱 **Undergraduate Education** @HFUT

From 2012 to 2016, I majored in Automation at the Department of Information Engineering, Hefei University of Technology (HFUT). I consistently ranked top in my major as well as the whole Department with a GPA of 92%, earning the National Scholarship (国家奖学金) each year. I achieved the first place in the HFUT Mathematics Competition.
