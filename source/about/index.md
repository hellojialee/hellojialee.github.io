## **Self-introduction**

Jia Li is currently a faculty with Hefei University of Technology (HFUT), Hefei, China. He received his Ph.D. degree from the School of Information Science and Technology, University of Science and Technology of China (USTC), Hefei, China, in 2021. Before that, he received his B.E. degree in automation from Hefei University of Technology, China in 2016. His current research interests are in computer vision and multimodal emotion recognition . He has published several papers in refereed journals and conferences such as TCSVT, TMM, AAAI, and ACM MM. He has obtained championships in two international challenges  (5th ABAW and 3rd MuSe) in the field of affective computing hosted by CVPR 2023 and MM 2022.
